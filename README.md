# InteractiveBook
Instead of doing a typical video or Art Installation, This year I Decided to use processing to make an interactive Book/trivia. Will go from easy ways of doing it and then along the way try making it into an efficient template for other uses

The creation of this Interactive Book is bring cultural awareness for Black History Month and other countries as well as our histories intertwine. The countries picked were just picked to see if I get a working model before continuing.
